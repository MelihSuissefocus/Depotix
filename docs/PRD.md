Inventory Management System – Feature Analysis and Requirements
Project Overview and Architecture
Inventory Management UI: The repository inventory-management-ui is a Next.js 13 application (TypeScript) with a modern design (Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components). It serves as the front-end dashboard for an inventory system, communicating with a Django REST Framework back-end (inventory-management-api). The UI is fully responsive for desktop and mobile and includes secure authentication (JWT-based) and interactive charts[1][2]. Users can log in or register, then manage inventory items and view insights via a web dashboard. The front-end uses environment-configured API endpoints (via NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL) to perform CRUD operations and fetch data.
Backend API: The back-end provides a RESTful API (with JWT auth) for all inventory operations[3][4]. It defines models for items, categories, suppliers, and inventory logs, and enforces role-based access (staff vs regular users)[2]. Key endpoints include:
- Authentication: Register, login, JWT token obtain/refresh[3].
- Items: List, create, update, delete inventory items[5]. Also special endpoints to adjust stock quantity and fetch low-stock items[6].
- Categories: CRUD for item categories (with search by name)[7].
- Suppliers: CRUD for suppliers (vendors) and linking items to suppliers[8][9].
- Inventory Logs: Record of stock changes (each addition/removal)[10].
- Reports/Status: Low-stock items query and stock level summaries for alerts[11].
The front-end is organized using Next.js App Router. It likely has separate pages or sections for each major feature (Dashboard, Inventory Items, Categories, Suppliers, Logs, Reports, Settings, etc.), as implied by commit history. State management is mostly handled via React hooks and direct fetch calls to the API (the project does not list a Redux or SWR dependency, so it likely uses fetch/async functions and local component state). The UI provides forms and tables for data management (leveraging Shadcn UI for consistent styling). Chart libraries (e.g. Chart.js or a similar tool) are used to visualize trends in the dashboard (inventory trends over time, category breakdowns, etc.), as indicated by commits referencing an InventoryTrendChart and data visualization of low stock.
Security & Roles: Authentication is JWT-based – users log in and receive a token which the UI attaches to API requests. The backend defines staff vs regular roles[2]. Staff users can manage all data, while regular users can only manage their own items. This means the app supports multiple user logins (e.g. the business owner and a partner can have separate accounts). The UI likely exposes this by showing all inventory if you are staff, or filtering to “your items” if not. There is also a user profile/settings page where users (or admins) can update profile info or passwords (commit notes indicate this exists).
Existing Features (Fully Implemented in Repo)
The current inventory management project already implements a broad set of features that align with many common logistics requirements:
•	Inventory Item Management: Users can add new products, update item details, and delete items from inventory[1]. Each item likely has fields such as name, SKU, category, quantity in stock, price, etc. The UI provides forms for creating/editing items and a list view for all items. (The backend supports full CRUD on /items/[5] and even an endpoint to adjust quantity without full edit[6].) This covers the basic “Artikel hinterlegen” (storing items) functionality.
•	Category Management: The system lets users define and organize product categories[1]. Categories can be created, edited, deleted via the UI, helping group inventory items. This is fully implemented (backend /categories/ endpoints[7] and a front-end categories page exist). It allows categorizing beverages by type, packaging, etc., which addresses part of item organization needs.
•	Dashboard with Analytics: A central dashboard displays key inventory metrics and trends[1]. It shows inventory trends over time, low-stock alerts, and recent activity logs[1]. For example, charts might plot stock level changes (trends) and a section highlights items that are low on stock (below minimum) for quick attention. A “recent activity” feed (backed by inventory logs) shows recent stock movements or item changes, giving the single-person supplier an overview of what happened recently. This fulfills “automatische Min. Lagerbestand erkennbar” by automatically flagging low stock levels. The backend explicitly provides a low-stock query and marks stock status (in stock/low/out)[12][11], which the UI uses to alert the user when an item’s quantity drops below a threshold.
•	Inventory Logs (Stock Movements): Every change in item stock (goods received or sold) is tracked in inventory logs on the backend[10]. The UI includes a page to view these logs (commit messages confirm a Logs page exists). Each log entry likely records the date, item, quantity change (+/-), and user performing the action. On the dashboard, recent log entries are summarized as “recent activity.” This provides traceability for Wareneingang & Warenausgang (incoming and outgoing stock): while there isn’t a separate “module” named goods-in/out, the adjust quantity feature and logs together handle that. Users can record stock increases (representing goods receipt) or decreases (goods issue) which update item counts and generate log entries.
•	Search and Filtering: The inventory list UI includes search functionality to quickly find items by name, SKU, or category[13]. Users can also sort and filter the list (e.g. filter by category or price range)[13]. This makes it easier to manage large numbers of products. A commit explicitly notes search by name/category/SKU was implemented. Filtering by category or stock status is likely available (the backend supports query filtering for items – e.g., it mentions filtering by category, price, etc.[14]).
•	Supplier Management: The system supports managing Suppliers (Lieferanten) information. The backend has full CRUD endpoints for suppliers[8], and commit history indicates a Suppliers page in the UI. Users can record supplier details (e.g. name, contact info) and associate suppliers with inventory items (the “Inventory Item Suppliers” endpoints link items to one or more suppliers[9]). This covers the “Lieferanten erfassen” part of requirements. For example, the beverage supplier can input from which vendor each drink is purchased. (Note: Customer records, however, are not present – see missing features below.)
•	Item–Supplier Linking: Related to suppliers, the app lets you assign which supplier provides a given item. The presence of /item-suppliers/ API endpoints[9] suggests the UI likely has a way to connect an item with its supplier(s) (perhaps in the item form or a dedicated page). This is useful for tracking procurement sources for each product.
•	Low Stock Alerts: On top of just listing low-stock items, the system may provide visual indicators or notifications when stock is low. The dashboard’s low-stock section highlights these items[1], and the backend can even send email alerts for low stock items[15]. In the UI, low-stock items might be marked (e.g. in red or with an icon) in inventory lists or summarized on the dashboard. This directly addresses automatic minimum stock detection.
•	Charts and Reports: The interface includes interactive charts for analytics[16]. For example, a chart might show inventory value or quantity over time (“inventory trend”), or a breakdown by category in a pie chart. A commit mentions an InventoryTrendChart and data calculation for it, so the dashboard likely has a line or bar chart plotting stock levels or sales trends over a period. There is also mention of a Reports page (via commits) – possibly a section where the user can see aggregated statistics or export data. While not explicitly described in README, this likely falls under “Charts and Analytics” and provides deeper insight into inventory movements (e.g. monthly stock changes, top-selling categories, etc.).
•	User Authentication & Profiles: The application has a secure login and registration system[17]. New users can sign up, and existing users log in with credentials (the backend issues JWT tokens for auth). This covers the basic multi-user access. Additionally, there is a User Settings/Profile feature: commit logs indicate a settings page where a user (or admin) can update profile details and change password. This means the one-man supplier can create a second account for a partner and both can log in separately. The system’s role-based access ensures that if both are staff, both can see and manage the full inventory. If one is a regular user, they would only see items they created – but in a small business scenario, likely both would be given staff role so they collaborate equally.
•	Role-Based Access Control: On the backend, staff vs regular user roles are implemented[2]. Staff (admin) can manage all inventory items and categories, whereas a regular user is restricted to their own entries. This feature is in place to support multi-user scenarios safely. For instance, if our supplier’s partner is given a login, one might designate them as a staff user too, so they have full access. (The UI might not have an elaborate role management UI, but it likely recognizes a “role” flag in the user profile to adjust some behaviors – e.g., perhaps only staff see supplier and log pages or can edit all items. Role assignment itself would be done via the backend/admin side.)
•	Notifications and UX: The commit history notes “user feedback notifications” on operations. The UI likely shows toast messages or alerts when actions succeed or fail (e.g. “Item added successfully” or error messages if something goes wrong) to enhance UX. Also, after any CRUD operation, the data is re-fetched to show up-to-date info (ensuring, for example, that after adding stock, the dashboard and lists update automatically).
•	Responsive & Modern UI: The front-end uses Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, providing a clean, desktop-friendly interface (as well as mobile responsiveness). It likely includes a sidebar or header navigation for switching between Dashboard, Inventory, Categories, Suppliers, Logs, etc. The design supports dark mode (as screenshots in the repo show both dark and light theme dashboards). All forms and tables are styled consistently and accessibly. This addresses the need for a desktop-optimized experience (the user specifically required a “desktop” solution, which this web app fulfills via browser on a desktop, with responsive design for smaller screens if needed).
Summary of Implemented Functions: In summary, the repository already covers: Inventory CRUD, Category CRUD, Supplier CRUD, assigning Suppliers to Items, View/adjust stock levels (goods in/out) with logs, Low-stock detection alerts, Dashboard charts and metrics, Search & filter, Authentication (multi-user), and basic user profile management[1][2]. These form a solid foundation of an inventory logistics application.
Missing Features (To Be Added)
Despite the robust set of features above, a few specific requirements from the one-man beverage supplier scenario are not yet implemented in the existing project. To meet all the outlined needs, the following functions would need to be developed or extended:
•	Detailed Goods In/Out Process: While stock adjustments are logged, the UI does not explicitly differentiate “Wareneingang” (goods received) vs “Warenausgang” (goods delivered out) as separate modules. Currently, the user can manually adjust item quantities (e.g., editing the quantity or using an “Adjust Quantity” action) and the system logs it, but there aren’t distinct forms/workflows for receiving shipments vs fulfilling orders. We should implement a clearer Goods Receipt workflow (for adding inventory with fields like supplier, date, reference) and a Goods Issue workflow (for recording when stock is sold or dispatched, possibly linking to customer or invoice). These could tie into the existing logs but provide more context (e.g. marking a log entry specifically as “Received from X” or “Sold to Y”). In practice, this might mean adding fields in the adjust stock form to choose “reason” or type (incoming vs outgoing) and possibly linking to supplier (for incoming) or customer/order (for outgoing). Currently, the repo’s data model does not appear to capture reason codes or customer info for a stock change – that would be an extension.
•	Tracking by Units (Pallets & Packages): The requirement “in Mengen von 1x Palette & Verpackung hinterlegbar” suggests the need to handle items in different units or packaging levels (e.g., tracking both full pallets and individual packages). The existing system treats item quantity as a single number (likely in base units). We would need to enhance it to support multiple unit measurements. For example, for beverages: one pallet might contain, say, 100 bottles (packages). The application should allow the item to be stocked as 1 pallet which automatically equals 100 pieces, or 0.5 pallet equals 50 pieces, etc. This could be implemented by adding fields like “quantity_per_pallet” and enabling input in pallets which the system converts to total units, or by representing inventory in two linked units. This functionality is not present out-of-the-box in the current repo (there’s no mention of multi-unit or packaging conversions). We will have to add logic in the UI (and possibly backend) to support defining a conversion factor for each product and then allow stock adjustments in either pallets or individual packages. This ensures the user can input stock in convenient terms (especially for bulk goods on pallets).
•	Handling Returns (Retournierte Artikel): There is no explicit feature for returned goods in the current system. A return would essentially be an incoming stock (increment) with a special designation. Right now, one can increase the stock count manually to account for a return, but it’s not distinguished from other additions. We should introduce a way to mark a stock increase as a return (from a customer). This might involve adding a “return” flag or reason in the adjust stock form or having a separate “Return Items” process that creates a log entry labeled as return. Additionally, tracking returns might imply linking to the original sale or customer who returned it – however, since sales/orders are not yet in the system, initially this could be as simple as a note in the log (“returned by customer”). To fully support returns, if we later implement customers and sales records, we’d tie the return to a customer record and possibly restock the item. Currently missing: any UI to specifically handle returns beyond generic stock adjustment.
•	Marking Defective/Damaged Stock: The existing application doesn’t have a way to mark items or specific units as defective. All inventory is treated as available stock. We need to add a feature to flag items or certain quantities of stock as damaged/unsellable. This could be done by adding an “is_defective” attribute on an inventory item or perhaps maintaining a separate count of damaged units. Possible approaches: a simple toggle on the item that marks it as currently not sellable (if all stock is defective), or more granular – e.g., record a portion of stock as defective via an adjustment (and possibly exclude it from available stock calculations). We might introduce a “Defect Report” action where the user can input a quantity of an item that became defective (e.g. broken bottles) – which would reduce available stock and log the event. The item record could then show both total stock and available stock (with defective units subtracted or tracked separately). Since neither the UI nor API currently mentions defective stock handling, this is a new extension to implement.
•	Customer Management: The requirement includes “Kunden erfassen” (managing customers), which is not implemented in the current project. The system has robust supplier management but no analogous customer entity. For a logistics app (especially if we plan to handle orders or deliveries), we need a Customer module. This would involve creating a new model in the backend (to store customer details like name, address, contact), adding API endpoints for customers (similar to suppliers), and building front-end pages to create/edit customer records. This will allow the one-man supplier to maintain a list of his clients (e.g., restaurants or shops he supplies drinks to). Once customers are tracked, other features like linking orders or invoices to customers become possible. So, adding a Customers page in the UI with full CRUD functionality is a priority to fulfill this gap.
•	Sales Orders & Delivery Notes/Invoices: Currently, the app does not handle sales/orders or any document generation. The requirement “Lieferschein/Rechnungsgenerierung” points to the need for creating delivery notes and invoices. This is a significant missing piece – essentially the sales side of inventory. To implement this, we’ll need to introduce the concept of a Sales Order or Delivery in the system. This could include: selecting a customer from the new customer list, choosing items and quantities to sell/ship, reducing the inventory accordingly, and then generating a delivery note or invoice document (likely PDF) that can be printed or emailed. The current repository has no such functionality; we would need to build a new module for orders/invoices. On the backend, that means creating models for Order (with order items, linking customers and inventory items) and endpoints to create/view them. On the front-end, we would add pages or forms for creating an order (choosing customer and items), and perhaps a way to list past orders or generate a PDF of an invoice. Integration with a PDF library or using an external service might be necessary for actual invoice document generation. This feature is entirely new – no mention of it exists in the present codebase.
•	Expense Tracking: The requirement “Ausgaben hinterlegen” suggests the user wants to record expenses (likely operational expenses or purchase costs). The current system does not include financial tracking aside from item pricing. We would need to incorporate an Expense management feature, which could be as simple as a ledger of expenses (date, description, amount, category of expense). This would allow the supplier to log costs like fuel, maintenance, or procurement costs that are not directly captured by inventory stock counts. Implementing this means adding an Expense model/API and a UI page to add expenses and maybe categorize them (e.g., “Purchase Cost” vs “Overhead”). It might also tie into inventory if we want to record purchase price per stock batch, but initially a standalone expense tracker may suffice. This feature is not present at all in the repository currently, so it’s a fresh addition.
•	Multi-User Enhancements: While the system supports a second login (the partner can have an account), we should verify if any additional setup is needed. The “zweites Login für Partner” requirement is essentially fulfilled by the existing authentication system – one can simply create another user. If the partner should have the same access level as the owner, an admin/staff role can be assigned to them. We might need to build an admin interface for managing user roles (e.g., an admin user could promote someone to staff). Currently, the project does not mention a UI for user administration (user creation is via registration and role assignment likely requires manually setting in the database or an admin panel outside the app). If the supplier is not technical, we might need to introduce a simple way to elevate the partner’s account to staff. Another consideration: if the partner should only see certain data, the role-based restrictions already handle normal vs staff scope. In summary, the authentication and multi-login exist, but a UI for role management may be missing. We should implement any needed adjustments so the partner can use the system easily (most likely by making them a staff user through the database or providing a toggle if we build that in the UI).
•	Customer-Specific Operations: Once customers and orders are introduced, we might also want to extend the reporting to cover sales per customer or inventory forecasts. While not explicitly asked, it’s a logical extension once those features are in place (e.g., generate a report of total sales to each customer, or which customers haven’t ordered recently, etc.). Additionally, if invoices are generated, tracking payments could be another aspect – but that goes beyond the immediate scope and isn’t requested explicitly.
•	Localization (Language): The current UI is written in English (labels, buttons, etc., as seen in the README screenshots). If the supplier requires the app in German (since the scenario was described in German), we may need to implement localization support. This would involve translating the UI text to German or making it multi-language. This wasn’t mentioned explicitly as a requirement, but it might be a consideration for real-world use by German-speaking users. The repository doesn’t have multi-language support out of the box.
•	Desktop Application Packaging: The requirement list mentions “desktop”, and the solution provided is a web app. If the intent was a standalone desktop application, we might consider using something like Tauri or Electron to wrap the web app into a desktop program. However, given the tech stack, it’s likely the user meant a web app accessible on desktop. The current Next.js app can be deployed and accessed via browser on any desktop, which meets the need. We do not necessarily need a separate desktop client, but we ensure the UI works well on PC (which it does by design – it’s responsive and built for desktop usage as well[18]).
•	Integration with Devices (optional): In some logistics contexts, barcode scanner integration or printing labels might be desired. These are not explicitly listed, and the repo does not handle them. If needed in the future, we’d have to integrate such features (likely out of scope for now but worth noting as not present).
•	Miscellaneous Missing Pieces: Since the repo is a solid base, other smaller features might be added as improvements:
•	Defining Minimum Stock per Item: The low-stock threshold might be globally fixed (e.g., low stock = quantity < 5) in the current system. A desirable addition is allowing each item to have its own minimum stock level configured. For instance, item A might be considered low below 10 units, item B below 3 units. We would add a field for “min_stock_level” on items and adjust the low-stock alert logic to use it. Currently, there’s no evidence of per-item thresholds in the API (no such field mentioned), so implementing that would enhance the automatic alert accuracy.
•	Audit and Permissions: If the partner should have slightly limited capabilities (e.g., can update stock but not delete items), more granular permission control could be introduced. Right now, it’s just staff vs regular. We may consider if needed to prevent accidental data deletion by certain roles.
•	UI Enhancements: The project likely does not include a mobile app or offline mode. If needed in the future (since it’s a one-man operation, probably not critical now), we might consider a PWA (Progressive Web App) configuration so the web app can be “installed” on a device and possibly used offline for short periods (this is not currently in the repo).
Summary of New Functions to Implement: In order to fully meet the supplier’s needs, we will extend the system with: Customer management (CRUD for clients), Sales/Order & Invoice generation (creating delivery notes tied to customers and deducting stock), Expense tracking (logging costs), unit-of-measure handling (pallets vs individual), return merchandise processing, defective stock marking, and possibly a UI for user/role administration. Each of these will involve back-end model and API work, as well as front-end pages and forms. These features are currently absent in the repository (neither in the UI nor API) and will need to be designed and built on top of the existing architecture.
<hr/>
By documenting the above, we have a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) foundation. This covers the current state of the Inventory Management project and the planned features to add. With this knowledge, a developer (or AI coding assistant in an IDE) can navigate the codebase confidently – knowing what is already implemented and where – and then proceed to implement the missing functionalities according to the requirements. The architecture (Next.js + DRF) supports these extensions, and the modular design (separate pages and API endpoints for each domain) will allow us to integrate new models like Customer or Order alongside existing ones like Item and Supplier. Overall, the combination of existing features[1] and planned enhancements will result in a complete logistics application tailored for a small beverage supplier's needs.

```

#### Customer Relationship Management
```python
class Customer(models.Model):
    # Contact information
    name, contact_name, email, phone
    
    # Business details
    address, shipping_address, tax_id
    credit_limit, payment_terms, notes
    
    # Relationship management
    owner, created_at, updated_at, is_active
```

#### Financial Tracking
```python
class Expense(models.Model):
    CATEGORY_CHOICES = [
        ('PURCHASE', 'Purchase'),
        ('TRANSPORT', 'Transport'),
        ('UTILITIES', 'Utilities'),
        ('MAINTENANCE', 'Maintenance'),
        ('OFFICE', 'Office'),
        ('MARKETING', 'Marketing'),
        ('OTHER', 'Other'),
    ]
    
    date, description, amount, category
    supplier, receipt_number, notes, owner
```

### Business Logic Implementation

#### Unit Conversion System
- **Base Unit**: Fundamental tracking unit (PIECE, KG, LITER, etc.)
- **Package Factor**: Units per package (e.g., 24 bottles per case)
- **Pallet Factor**: Packages per pallet (e.g., 60 cases per pallet)
- **Conversion**: `pieces_per_pallet = package_factor × pallet_factor`

#### Stock Management Rules
- **Available Stock**: `total_quantity - defective_quantity`
- **Low Stock Alert**: `available_qty <= min_stock_level`
- **Defective Tracking**: Separate from main inventory but counted in total
- **Validation**: Defective quantity cannot exceed total quantity

#### Future-Ready Architecture
The Phase 1 implementation includes foundations for Phase 2 features:
- **StockMovement**: Enhanced replacement for InventoryLog (documented, not implemented)
- **SalesOrder**: Order management system (documented, ready for implementation)
- **Invoice**: Invoice generation with numbering system (documented)
- **Numbering System**: LS-YYYY-#### and INV-YYYY-#### patterns (documented)

### Technical Documentation

#### Complete Documentation Set
- 📋 **DATA-MODEL.md**: Comprehensive ERD and field definitions
- 📋 **NUMBERING.md**: Business document numbering system
- 📋 **SETUP.md**: Updated with Phase 1 backend setup instructions
- 📋 **Seed Data**: `fixtures/seed_phase1.json` with 24 demo objects

#### Database Implementation
- **Migrations**: Complete Django migrations for all models
- **Constraints**: Database-level validation and integrity constraints
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for frequent queries
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships with cascade handling

### Development Workflow

#### Backend Setup
```bash
cd api/
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata ../fixtures/seed_phase1.json
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Integration Points
- **Frontend**: Existing Next.js frontend remains compatible
- **API Endpoints**: All existing endpoints supported via DRF serializers
- **Admin Interface**: Django admin available at `/admin/`
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-ready for production

### Open Points for Phase 2

#### Sales Order Implementation
While the data model is documented, the SalesOrder and Invoice models need to be:
- Implemented in Django models
- Added to serializers and admin
- Integrated with numbering system
- Connected to frontend workflows

#### Enhanced Stock Operations
The StockMovement model (documented) should replace InventoryLog:
- Support for movement types (IN/OUT/RETURN/DEFECT/ADJUST)
- Unit type tracking for movements
- Customer/supplier references for movements
- Enhanced business logic for stock operations

#### Integration Enhancements
- PDF generation for invoices
- Email integration for document delivery
- Enhanced API endpoints for complex operations
- Advanced reporting and analytics
